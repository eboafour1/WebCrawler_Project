<h2 class="flex anchor group" id="as-is-and-as-available-disclaimer">
  <span> &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; and &ldquo;AS AVAILABLE&rdquo; Disclaimer</span> <a class="mr-2 order-first" href="#as-is-and-as-available-disclaimer">ðŸ”—</a></h2>
<p>The Service is provided to You &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; and &ldquo;AS AVAILABLE&rdquo; and with all faults and defects without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service, including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.</p>

<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.</p>
<h2 class="flex anchor group" id="recruiting-partners">
  <span> Recruiting Partners</span> <a class="mr-2 order-first" href="#recruiting-partners">ðŸ”—</a></h2>
<p>If you are a recruiting partner of Boot.dev (you have been granted access to the &ldquo;recruiters&rdquo; view), then the following rules apply to you.</p>
<p>If you contact a candidate you found through Boot.dev you must disclose to them in your initial outreach that you found them through Boot.dev.
If a candidate asks you to, you must remove them from all your organization&rsquo;s contact lists.
When a candidate is successfully placed in a job, you&rsquo;re required to notify Boot.dev on or before their first day and will pay the agreed-upon referral fee. Failure to do so is theft.
